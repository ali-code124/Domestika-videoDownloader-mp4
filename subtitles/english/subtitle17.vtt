We would already have our
cylinder for the jewel headband ready.

92
17:31.408 --> 17:35.760
Now we need to take our
headband that we have made initially,

93
17:35.760 --> 17:38.938
as the basic flat
headband, and we complete it.

94
17:39.740 --> 17:43.473
Now what we will do is
create an angular shape.

95
17:46.220 --> 17:50.017
We mark first with pins here

96
17:53.340 --> 17:54.657
and here.

What we must do, now that we are here,

61
09:04.400 --> 09:05.840
is to give it another pass,

62
09:08.320 --> 09:10.810
so this thread is already locked here.

63
09:10.810 --> 09:14.230
It's like when you do a job
on the computer and hit Save

64
09:14.230 --> 09:16.240
in case it gets
deleted, this is the same.

65
09:16.240 --> 09:18.588
If we do not click
Save, the thread is cut

66
09:18.588 --> 09:21.100
and everything we have
sewn is gone and we lose it.

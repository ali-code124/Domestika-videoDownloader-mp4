12:02.743 --> 12:05.400
You have to tighten it
and remember to tie the knots

77
12:05.410 --> 12:09.603
because in the case of not making those
knots between ball and ball, look what happens,

78
12:09.603 --> 12:13.770
that I pull from here
and this one stays loose

79
12:13.770 --> 12:17.650
because they decompensate each other.

80
12:17.650 --> 12:20.400
That is why it is important
in each pass to finish it off.

81
12:20.400 --> 12:24.652
In the event that we did not realize it
and by mistake we were left with a loose one,

82
12:24.652 --> 12:26.460
when we pass by again,

83
12:26.460 --> 12:29.070
we passed the thread
again and tightened it

84
12:29.070 --> 12:32.800
so that it fixes us again and
we don't have a dancing ball left.

85
12:52.630 --> 12:57.430
Now I will go on to make
sequences of three miyukis for you to see.

86
12:57.430 --> 12:59.457
It is exactly the same.

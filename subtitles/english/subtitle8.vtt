48
08:03.610 --> 08:05.980
and say 10 for this
side and 10 for this side.

49
08:05.980 --> 08:09.908
Start from end to end
so as not to fall short.

50
08:09.908 --> 08:10.920
It's very important.

51
08:32.660 --> 08:34.700
We put the balls through each hole

52
08:36.675 --> 08:38.260
and we are moving forward.

53
08:38.773 --> 08:40.930
We are pulling the
thread where it comes out.

54
08:40.930 --> 08:43.960
In this way we will cover everything.

55
08:43.960 --> 08:46.993
You have to be careful with what
happened to me, which are the knots,

56
08:47.650 --> 08:49.750
and stretch carefully.

57
08:50.720 --> 08:54.190
It is very important that
when we move to the next point

58
08:54.193 --> 08:57.888
let's not put another stone and
move forward, because as this is padding

59
08:57.888 --> 09:00.620
the stones will loosen
and some will hang us.

Some are made of Czech crystal,
others are made of Swarovski crystal.

28
07:06.170 --> 07:08.390
and it depends a little on
the brightness of each one.

29
07:09.400 --> 07:12.803
I recommend you do some sequences:

30
07:12.803 --> 07:15.890
"Now I will put the
ones that are darker purple,

31
07:15.890 --> 07:17.830
now I will make the purples lighter",

32
07:17.830 --> 07:22.120
and a little to do the
strategy and the sequences of the balls

33
07:22.120 --> 07:24.580
so that you do not
have unbalanced parts.

34
07:24.580 --> 07:27.850
I want to do a gradient
and put more balls here

35
07:27.850 --> 07:32.100
because in this way we will cover
the ugliness of having sewn this.

36
07:32.100 --> 07:35.992
I want to start with a little
more here and let it go here.

37
07:35.992 --> 07:39.370
This part of the sides is
always more complicated to sew,

38
07:39.370 --> 07:40.773
with which many times

39
07:40.773 --> 07:43.323
we tend to load this
part and forget about it,

40
07:43.323 --> 07:47.148
but we must not forget that the
headband, the protagonism, will have it frontal.

41
07:47.148 --> 07:48.640
Therefore, it is important

42
07:48.640 --> 07:50.800
the lateral parts also work them.

43
07:51.460 --> 07:54.650
We start sewing from the first point.

44
07:54.650 --> 07:55.855
What do we do?

45
07:55.855 --> 07:56.985
I also recommend

46
07:56.988 --> 07:59.540
averaging a little the product we have.

47
07:59.540 --> 08:03.610
If we have 20, 20, 20, we can mark half

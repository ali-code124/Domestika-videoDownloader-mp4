06:41.680 --> 06:43.085
We already have the band sewn.

21
06:43.085 --> 06:45.430
Now we will move on to
sewing the rhinestones.

22
06:45.430 --> 06:48.198
We will see the rhinestones
that I have chosen for this lesson.

23
06:49.730 --> 06:53.270
They are all tupis,
which is a type of glass cut.

24
06:53.838 --> 06:57.028
When they are like this
kind of rhombus, they are tupis,

25
06:57.028 --> 06:59.990
and miyukis, which
is a crystal rockery,

26
06:59.990 --> 07:02.660
They all have exactly the same size.

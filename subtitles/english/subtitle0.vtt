Introduction and
finishes of the jewel headband

2
00:09.210 --> 00:12.240
We start as always by
hiding the knot first.

3
00:15.340 --> 00:16.600
The technique is very similar

4
00:16.600 --> 00:18.963
to which we have
used to make the moulage.

5
00:23.010 --> 00:24.120
We take out here.

6
00:30.090 --> 00:33.390
We take a bit of fabric in the middle.

7
00:36.620 --> 00:37.733
We come here.

8
00:47.450 --> 00:50.330
We always have to make
sure that we are catching

9
00:50.330 --> 00:52.940
both the band fabric
and the headband fabric

10
00:52.940 --> 00:54.213
so that we don't move.

10:45.330 --> 10:47.730
We finish off and
leave this small knot.

68
10:47.730 --> 10:52.560

balls, we just put a bead there

10:52.560 --> 10:55.500
so that we cover that
knot and it is not visible.

10:56.350 --> 10:58.590
Now we are going to sew the miyukis.

71
10:58.590 --> 11:02.410
The miyukis do not have a great
mystery with respect to the others either.

19:17.050 --> 19:18.913
We throw a little more from here.

104
19:38.300 --> 19:42.208
Now what we need is to curve this part.

105
19:44.417 --> 19:45.710
We accentuate this

106
19:47.080 --> 19:50.260
to achieve the effect we want.

107
19:50.260 --> 19:51.793
Important things.

108
19:51.793 --> 19:54.150
We must stretch the fabric
well once it is placed here

109
19:54.150 --> 19:58.560
because it will create wrinkles,
bags and others that will not be pretty.

110
19:58.560 --> 20:03.120
It is very important that we put one
side, tighten the other and equalize.

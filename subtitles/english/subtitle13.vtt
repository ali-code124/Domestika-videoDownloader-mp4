87
13:04.310 --> 13:06.620
I take all three miyukis at once.

88
13:06.620 --> 13:10.370
What I have to take into account is
the distance to take out the needle.

89
13:10.370 --> 13:13.850
I put the other one in and out
practically through the same hole.

90
13:13.850 --> 13:18.560
In this case we calculate more
or less the 3 mm of the miyukis

91
13:18.560 --> 13:20.513
and we move on to the next.

92
13:22.660 --> 13:23.937
We finish.

93
13:27.000 --> 13:29.408
We take another three.

94
13:35.270 --> 13:36.993
We leave the distance.

95
13:40.720 --> 13:43.220
These are the sequences to
follow with the rhinestones

96
13:43.220 --> 13:46.060
to get the result
of our jewel headband.

97
13:46.060 --> 13:47.680
Thus completing the whole band

98
13:47.680 --> 13:51.640
and covering the part of
the tips with more beads.

99
13:51.640 --> 13:54.513
I will continue working and
now I show you the final result.
